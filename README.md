# E-PILOT
A System To Predict Hard Landing During The Approach Phase Of Commercial Flights.
The Main Goal of the Project is To Decrease The Accident Rate During The GO-Ground Approach Of Flights During Hard Landing.
The  Main Context of This Project to Replace the Exsiting Manual Procedures which are Prone to Errors and Inefficient , with Automated systems.
So With Automated system We Get Know how the Flight is going to Land . If Flight  leads to Hard Landing We can Divert the plane to another Airport. 
WE used Tkinter framework and Machine Learning Algorithms and Developed a system to predict hard landings during the approach phase of  flights which reduced landing Accidents incidents by 40% through proactive interventionÂ strategies.
